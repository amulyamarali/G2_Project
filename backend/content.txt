Learn more about best practices and ways to leverage their platform. It helped us gain a lot of visibility in the market and respect amongst our customers. 
If you're a Saas company focused on growth, you need Advocately in your sales and marketing stack.
The success of Advocately ultimately falls back on quality of your own product or service. Advocately facilitates amplifying your advocates, but you do need to deliver a quality product or service that deserves having advocates.
Make sure you know where you would like the reviews to be gathered and set up the platform before you engage Advocately. 
Qualify your list! 
Just do it. If it doesn't have every feature on your wish list just let the Advocately team know. They are so receptive to feedback and customer insight. 
Follow their advice. They have a playbook that generates proven results.
It's changed how we get reviews. Simple integrations with other products and great support. 
If you are a B2B SaaS company, seriously, just use it.
If you want the best insights into customer reviews and comparative anaylsis, G2Crowd has the answers.
Keep doing what you're doing! It all works great!
It has more reviews, more useful reviews and more credibility than other sites.
Awesome product to boost up the number of reviews. Go for it! 
If you have the budget, want to build your online review presence, and have time to commit to really taking advantage of all they have to offer, I recommend giving it a try.
Make sure you research the integrity of the review sites you do business with. They are not all created equal and G2 Crowd is definitely a leader in this segment. Also make sure you get the most out of your investment by leveraging the badges and reviews campaigns, depending on what type of listing you pay for. A lot of people may not realize you can reach out to G2 Crowd for quotes in blog posts and press releases. They are always willing to work with us on these efforts. We will definitely continue doing business with them. 
I would just recommend making reviews a high focus and shoot to make it in the leader board in your category. 
Check out the other review sites, find out whether the reviews and sufficient quality and quantity.  I suspect you will find that G2Crowd wins hands down.
Great way of providing prospects with excellent reviews of your products to speed the purchase decision process.
SImplify. Also  you guys should very quickly figure out how to better leverage the visitors data that you make available in your platform. As the raw data just sitting there it is not very helpful to customers but there is a lot that can be done with that.
I think G2Crowd will be a key player in the future buying journey of B2B solutions. It would be smart to establish your presence early. They have a Freemium option, so it offers a great deal of flexibility for all budgets. 
Provide a full assessment of what you need for your program and G2 Crowd will make it happen.
The team at G2 is fantastic to work with - take their advice, and you can't go wrong. 
Make use of the $500 stipend on a reviews campaign.
Turn to the rep you are in communication with if you bump into a problem because the support is really good and they will help you right away.
We haven't yet seen an ROI, but we are in the begiining phase of this partnership. I hope to come back next year and tell a different story. However, after our first review campaign we got 60+ reviews in a very short amount of time.
It's a good platform with good service people that help you every step of the way.
This service is easy to set-up and use. We've had a lot of success in having our customers use it to submit reviews.
It depends on if you have enough competitors that are signed up on G2 Crowd. If not, It's basically a glorified review tool for branding and awareness.
Take advantage of learning what content from G2 Crowd can be leveraged elsewhere and how to best use it early on. We are still in the process of doing this but the G2 Crowd team has been very helpful in educating us on this. 
Get us an easy to use API so that we can hook it up to enrichment vendors like LeadLander, etc. We need to be able to see the ROI on pageviews. Without getting us this ROI data, there is an upper limit on how much we will pay for G2C. Adding it would allow us to pay more.  When I have requests that require the help of a product or engineering team, the turnaround can be between a few days to a week or so. It would be great to speed up the cross-functional questions.
Add to it.  As this platform is all about reviews from the real life community, it gets better with the more active community members contribute to the site.    Continue to monitor it.  Similar to Yelp or Glassdoor or other review sites, it can provide great insights into the health of your business.  
I would go thru the onboarding and sales process as it is eye opening on how they can help your marketing team.
Ask Questions and leverage G2's documentation. 
The reps are extremely knowledgable and responsive, so I would make sure that you speak with them as much as possible during the sales and implementation stages. They will help you figure out if/how G2 Crowd aligns with your goals and every use case you could have for their service.
Do not get baffled by the extensivity of this platform. It takes a little time to get used to, but once that's taken care off, it's a strong solution for B2B software. 
G2 Crowd offers fantastic support during the initial rollout and provides some of the best options for leveraging the customer reviews in your future marketing and sales efforts. Definitely check them out.
Cast a wide net with your reviews. Get real feedback that prospects can trust and can help you understand where you are strong and where you can improve.
G2 has helped our customers publicly validate us to prospects and has helped us build pipeline and be considered for opportunities where we likely would not have been found otherwise. Also it has aided as a great validation point for customers in meetings and demo's as to our market profile and position.  It has helped us need less reference calls and enabled our customers to have a more open and valid place to voice their opinion on us.
It showcases a wide range of vendors with unbiased and helpful reviews for evaluating solutions within your organization. This helps companies accelerate their marketing efforts and sales cycles when shared effectively.   The smart grid is also a really great way to show how your company is perceived in the market place.  Quarterly reports are very detailed and are helpful overviews for companies trying to evaluate vendors. 
Great way to build our brand in a new space, by leveraging user success. Also, Alex Pike did a great job of helping us understand the value of the platform when we first started.
The end to end service and process has been the highlight to my experience. Advocately has ensured our success by assisting us with implementing our review campaigns. They've consistently optimised our process to achieve our goals.
Advocately facilitates a continuous flow of great reviews of your product or service on the top review sites across the web. We have had excellent service and it is clear that Advocately is committed to getting the best results for their clients. They have a vision for this space that I have not seen before, and it is a welcome innovation. 
It works exactly as intended. Promoters get pro-active outreach for review requests in a way that is not over-the-top. The team at advocately have made themselves available at every step in the onboarding journey as well. Great service
We were previously using engagement as a criteria for requesting a review (which we were doing manually). The blend of using NPS along with the automation Advocately provides means we are getting a higher volume of higher quality reviews for less work.
Getting reviews is an integral part of any (online) business these days but the process can be very time consuming and hard. With Advocately the entire process is automated which is a huge work load lifted. After the initial setup you just let the system do the work for you, the support is great and the product works like a charm. I can highly recommend Advocately to anyone who relies on reviews! 
We are getting our promoters to write reviews online and refer their friends at an extremely high rate!  We can link the results from this back to revenue.
Advocately helped us reach out to our top promoters and helped build out our reviews across our different platforms.
Being in Customer Success, it is extremely important to know how your customers feel about your product and service and getting constant feedback is absolutely necessary. With Advocately, we get an all-in-one platform that gives us the data we need to help us engage better with our clients.
Advocately helps us to automate the process of reaching out to get reviews from customers that love our product. Another feature I like is the ability to explore which users are our net promoters. This is much potential to continuously refine our market segments using this tool.
Advocately has provided us on the best insights to run our NPS campaign and to generate the reviews that are essential for customer advocacy in the SaaS solutions industry.   They identified what works best for us in terms of getting a favorable response rate from the NPS surveys and we really have moved forward from there.
Advocate.ly is extremely easy to use. Patrick was very helpful in setting us up on the platform. The integration and set up was quick, templates were provided to get the best result. Everything is engineered for our success, i am very happy with the platform. 
As a Community Manager I am responsible for crafting and executing our advocate program. Perhaps the most challenging aspect of creating an advocate program is finding the advocates. Advocately has eliminated challenge. The advocates, through Advocately, came to me! Not only do I now have a growing list of advocates, but I am able to see exactly what they love about our software. This enables me to push feedback to the marketing, development, and customer success teams so that we can enhance what people love.  Aside from the actual product, Patrick and Lachlan are amazing. Support, response times, and personality are all 10/10. You guys rock!
The support, and the experience the Advocately founders bring in having done exactly what Advocately promises for a SaaS business just like ours. The offering is spot on, and simply works. 
I used to go through a lot of steps to get reviews. I was probably spending 5-6 hours a month to get reviews. There were so many manual steps and we would barely get any reviews out of it. It always felt worth it because our Brand and reputation is very important to us. Now, with Advocately, I just set up campaigns and they take care of the rest. We initially tested it out on 40 users and within that we produced 20 reviews!!!!! The same subset of users would probably would have produced 2 or 3 reviews within my old process.   Also, the support has been amazing! Patrick has extremely helpful at setting us up and guiding us through the onboarding process. He has been very flexible in the hours he has helped and I've always very quickly got a response to questions. 
Advocately is very easy to use and we�ve received outstanding support from their team. It helped us understand our customer�s requirements better. We were able to see results in just a few months! 
At Saleswhale, we are new to NPS and getting customer reviews on G2 Crowd. At first, I was concerned that it was going to be hard to get all these up and running manually, but Advocately has made getting setup a breeze for us.  And within the first day of getting setup on Advocately, we ran our first NPS survey, got dozens of responses, which Advocately then automatically reached out to - and we got our first 5 star review on that day itself.  Support from Patrick has been top-notch, and he was very patient and helpful in walking us through the entire process from start to finish.
Tells you what categories a company falls into, who they're competitors are, and what it's strengths/weaknesses are in the market place by way of customer reviews as well as their own analysis.
G2Crowd is a great resource in understanding comparative reviews when it comes to understanding customer satisfaction, competitor analysis and the benefits to using certain solutions.
G2Crowd enables us to be able to show how well our product works, how customers view us and close more deals because of it.
G2 crowd has allowed us to let our customers speak directly to our customers. As a sales person, I don't want to constantly be bogging down my customers with asking them to give a reference for prospects who aren't far into the sales funnel. G2 crowd allows me to provide referrals to prospects, without having to annoy my customers, before my prospects are fully qualified. I also love the full transparency required by G2, as my customers can trust that the information they are getting is trustworthy.
The reviews, especially the fact they include 'what do you dislike' as well as 'what do you like'.  It gives a much more rounded picture.  The grids are useful, so too the ability to run grids based on user segment.  I also like the side-by-side comparisons.
Easy to setup, Best Support and good pricing!  
G2Crowd's platform is a great way to drive advocacy from your customers. Asking clients to review your product is a sure way to know how they actually feel about you, and in return you're empowering sales with a easy way to reach our for references pre-sales.
I like how easy it is to run reviews campaigns and leverage the tools in your listing to market you business. Have our listings on G2 Crowd has helped us tremendously in building trust and credibility with out prospects and close more business.
Gina Carr goes the extra mile . She is a huge help and a pleasure to work with. There is a real commitment on her part to help her clients succeed
We've received decent service pretty consistently. The online platform is easy enough to work through. Leads are just okay.
Overall, I am very happy with G2 Crowd. We are able to drive high quality leads to our sales team. Our reps are also great, fast to respond and always helpful.
G2 Crowd's team is amazing to work with! They are always very responsive and are always proactively reaching out to make sure we get the best results of the programs we are running. You can't get a better CSM than Andrew Ledet! 
G2Crowd has invested heavily in advertising their brand versus the other review sites.  As a result they have a much bigger quantity of reviews.  So it has traction now and people trust it to create a shortlist and to determine what others think.
G2 Crowd provides a very impartial and fully verified technology software review forum. The technology sections are well defined and nicely summarized.  Overall, it's very professional and you can actually count on the review provided since they can't be manipulated by the vendors.   Really like the way that we can embed the review widgets on our own website with links to our optimized landing page.  The environment provides a great user experience for visitors to our website and illustrates how open we are to input from our customers. The style of review presentation is also very easy for visitors to consume. It's similar to consumer based review sites, but with much higher data quality.  We count on the fact that prospects reading our reviews can trust the customer input.
I really enjoy working with G2 Crowd for a few reasons, one of them being their customer support. The team at G2 Crowd has worked hand in hand with Certify to create custom content to better suit our needs and help position Certify stronger in the selling process.   From a technology standpoint, I really value the competitive analysis aspect of G2 Crowd. The fact that a prospect can search and compare over 1,000 reviews on expense management in minutes and rank the top performing vendors is really invaluable. Having this Yelp-like review process for business software has allowed us to showcase our strengths against competitors and replace the traditional client referral process. 
I originally signed up with G2 Crowd to generate awareness of our solution as they had the most product/ competitor reviews for our industry (PR tools and media targeting) and had a robust process to help you generate reviews for products. But I was blown away, when on top of awareness and SEO magic, G2 Crowd has also become a key source of sales leads for us. 
The configuration and on-boarding process for a vendor is very straightforward, intuitive and yet comprehensive. I also like the experience provided by G2Crowd to users researching products. It is fluid and informational. 
I like the clean look and feel of the website. They also have instant chat which is nice if you have a question that you need answered really quickly. The CSM I have is knowledgeable, responsive and helpful.
I've appreciated the opportunity to get honest reviews from our customers. It's opened up the opportunity to hear their feedback and also showcase our value to prospects.   Additionally, I've loved the customer support I've gotten from Mark! He's always been incredibly helpful, friendly, honors his commitments, and holds me accountable for getting our campaign done!
We are in a competitive marketplace and we rely on G2 Crowd to help us stand out from our competitors.  
I think the Customer Success Management team is really accessible and helpful when I have questions.
I've used G2crowd now for over 3 years at different companies and we continue to utilize them as a trusted vendor because of the ability to gather feedback from clients quickly and easily. By running review campaigns we can uncover what areas of focus we need for our product and how to identify new advocates for our programs. The grid reports also help us stay relevant to our competitors and the marketplace.
It's a great resource if you're looking for honest reviews on a software solution. You can read through both the good and bad about a particular offering, so that you can walk into purchase decisions much better informed. 
Site is so easy to use - even for the most non-tech person like me! Also, G2 Crowd team is very responsive when you have questions or concerns and does their best to either fix the problem or get others from the extended team involved to resolve or come up with a viable and workable solution. One very nice capability is the widget tool. I love that it's embedded in the admin portal and it's super easy to understand and share. It's definitely something that I will use to help socialize the customer reviews.
