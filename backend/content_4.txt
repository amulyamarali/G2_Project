Hate comments about G2 Marketing Solution 
Not a lot to dislike.  Be great as G2 becomes more recognised by a wider audience and gives the Gartners a run for their money. 
There aren't enough people open to reviewing products without an incentive. I still think that reviewers are honest and unbiased, but the volume is still much lower than you'd expect.   It is costly, but we saw an ROI within weeks of launching our paid subscription with closing a relatively large deal through a lead that came in via G2Crowd. 
So far so good, we are just starting to use additional features like the LinkedIn integration so can't evaluate that yet
There is little that I dislike. Understanding exactly what each of the features means and the flow between them has been my only slight hindrance. 
This is not a true dislike, but the success of Advocately for us depends on at least one other integrated service, which we fortunately already had in place.
Not much at this point, we just need to figure out how best to integrate it into our other systems, particularly for our Customer Success team to follow up on the passive and detractor comments. No doubt I'll get the help I'm looking for.
Very little. The product is currently quite feature-light but the future is bright and loads of potential.
Hard to come up with anything I dislike, if pressed I would say that it would be good to have a simple explainer video of 1 minute which would quickly show the value and functionality - in the beginning it is a bit hard to understand exactly what Advocately does :-) 
Nothing right now.  I'm excited to see how the Advocately platform develops.
Advocately is still a very early product - not a ton on reporting yet, but we're excited to see where they're headed
I really can't think of anything right now.
There isn't anything I dislike at the moment. The product solves one problem and solves it well. Having such focus is a breathe of fresh air from other products that try to do too many things but do them poorly.
Advocately ihas been working with us with a Tailor Made Approach to our NPS Campaign, and this is not something which is readily available.  Most NPS Products in the market are just products with limited advisory on best practices, organizations will need to invest time to find the best way to implement their campaigns successfully.   What Advocately can bring in the future to their clients, are stellar examples of NPS campaigns execution.
There is nothing to dislike. As Advocately is relatively new, the features will continue to grow with the feedback of users. 
Nothing at all. It's all good, an outstanding offering.
It's a newer product, so I feel like initially there's a bit more hand holding to get onboarded on the product. Saying that, the support was amazing and Patrick helped me get fully up and running very quickly. 
Haven't had a bad experience so far.  :)
I was about to say lack of Slack integration until Patrick showed me that they have built it in, and got us integrated. They move fast on the product and engineering side - and I look forward to seeing more features from the Advocately team.
What they consider 'Midmarket' seems too small to me. Think this could be changed or made more granular.
I can't say that I dislike anything in particular
I have no complaints when it comes to using G2crowd.
Sometimes it sucks when a customer leaves some negative information, but with that it allows us to understand what we need to work on in order to improve. 
I like the category grids but there are some where I question the validity of certain vendors to appear in them.  I have some questions around the market presence algorithm but can understand why it needs to remain secret.  Finally, I think some of the reports - especially around usability and ease of set-up - currently mitigate against larger vendors with more sophisticated solutions; these feel a little unfair.
Nothing as such. Started using this tool a month and feeling really good about the way it has brought in reviews. 
I wish it was less of a burden for my customers to fill out a review.
I really can't think of anything I dislike about G2 Crowd. 
 It takes a lot of work to get your product profile set up on the site. There is a lot of information to complete and it can be a bit confusing. 
The LinkedIn log in is pretty hard to work with.
The only drawback I currently have would be the low volume. I am working with the reps to find a solution to help us increase our volume. 
The only thing I can think of for improvement is there is still a lot of reliability on AdRoll for activating retargeting programs. 
G2Crowd rank not given enough prominence. Don't like paid for reviews (think this should be charity donation only) as encourages people to make up reviews.  I think there should be some way of seeing the balance of reviews from particular companies (at the moment you could have 100 reviews from a single customer which could skew review count).
Difficult to say what I dislike, but if I had to choose I would say that sometimes the technology categories are too general. This can result sometimes in very different, non-competitive products in the same category.  This makes products hard to compare at times.
Setting up the product profiles is a bit cumbersome and I wish we could have a corporate page with individual products listed so people could see our entire portfolio. 
Nothing.  G2Crowd is a great company, they just need to extend their SEO penetration (at least in my category) to better generate organic leads.
I wish the average/total score would be updated more frequently. It looks like I have gotten a lot of 4.5 and mostly 5 star ratings, but it hasn't moved in like 9 months or so. It used to move more frequently at the beginning when we first drove traffic to the site, when I first started.
Honestly, I haven't really found anything.
We don't see a lot of people actually request a demo from our G2 profile page, but that is not unexpected.  
The system could be a bit more intuitive and cleaner for end users coming to look at reviews. You guys should get rid of that grid. It is confusing as heck. I am not a proponent of copy catting all the time, but on this one you could just take a que from Yelp or Tripadvisor in terms of how to present the best company in each category.  A list view is much better and simpler.  Also, I think you guys should better figure out the right companies that should be in a respective category. For us, there are people in our category whose primary product is not in our category yet they are able to rank higher than us in our category because they got more reviews in there primary category. It's a bit misleading I think for the end users relying on your site for reviews.
I wish there was more customization with the review questions and a way to provide ongoing feedback from customers that have posted reviews previously. Other review sites allow this and it would be great to have this feature added. 
I wish the company had even stronger brand awareness - several other colleagues in B2B haven't heard of the platform yet, so it will take a bit longer to build higher credibility/become the gold standard for reviews. 
Would like to see reviews dive a bit deeper into the customer's usage such as use case. Also, it would be nice to have extended sorting capabilities such as region and use case.
I'd like to be able to tag the reviews to identify common themes and export the reviews into an excel or csv. doc. 
I have nothing to say here. We are wishing good luck and future growth for Advocately. 
At least for the program we are running, G2 requires a lot of internal resources in order to garner the full benefits of the platform. I believe it will pay off in terms of high quality leads/ROI; however, expect some time to see significant results. 
I wish to gain more visibility or training on how to utilize the features/tools G2 has put in place.
Because G2 Crowd offers so many reports I wish the price wasn't so high to license each one.
We're trying out their sponsored content marketing program, but it's in its early stages and hasn't produced impressive results yet. It could be due to the ad design, but we'd like to see better results.  Their webhooks feature for leads is a little confusing, if you don't have any web dev experience.  The evaluation grid seems to favor market size, so if you don't work with enterprise businesses, you will never be labeled as a 'market leader' despite having a top notch review portfolio.   The comparison reports are overpriced for smaller startups.
Sometimes the leads that arrive are highly unqualified but I'm not sure that's G2's fault.
At this current time, there is nothing that I am unhappy with.
Not much that I dislike that we haven't solved with iteration on targeting, messaging & etc
1. G2Crowd promised lots of leads, but leads are few and far 2. The embed feature is limiting - I do not have the ability to take specific sections from the testimonial and embed them. 
Outside of the basics, ideas are limited. Suggestions seem to always include spending more money with them. Inbound lead activity wasn't great in our experience, but we have a very specific product.
The grid.  The way G2 assesses market presence is misleading.
Would love to be able to customize qualification questions before anyone can request a demo. 
I don't like that some elements on the profile page are not customizable, for example, the Watch a Demo button cannot be renamed.
the survey process to review your company is like a million questions
We've been with G2 Crowd for only a few months. So far we have been pleased with what we have received.
I had a little trouble at first with establishing contact with our ongoing rep. The person who helped us set up the campaign and review site was super helpful and clear in her instructions.
Nothing to dislike here. They are very open to any feedback we have provided. 
There is nothing about the solution that we do not like
I have a variety of products that I am using and I wish all three could be on the same page. It's kind of annoying to send customers different pages to write reviews on if they use more than one of our products.
logging in is easy, but I wish it would send me straight to my company profile instead of having to search for it.
We can't use our own form, which is not a deal breaker.
the lead scoring  for the reports is  heavily influenced  by volume rather than quality .
Since we don't use the portal on a regular basis, it can be challenging at times to know where everything is at and how to make changes. It would be great if as an admin I could select a series of reviews that I'd like to highlight and make them available on our website. It would be great to see a G2 Crowd brand-free RSS feed that would allow us to publish testimonials to our website. 
The lead feature has been of absolutely no use to us.
I have no dislikes with G2 at this time.  
Not much really, the account managers are very helpful and open to feedback. It can be a bit pricey for small business, but not above market rate. 
Some of the predefined page set ups. For example, the word "software" is at the end of our product name.  The product is a software but the sentence sounds odd with software at the end. 
It's impossible (or at least very hard) to quantify the ROI. You can track your demo requests from G2C in Salesforce and measure that ROI, but I think the true value of G2C lies in the TOFU brand awareness you get from people viewing your page. And the data you get about your pageviews is not good. You're handed IP addresses that get matched against a spotty database (e.g. you will see a lot of "Comcast LLC viewed your page") and that's it. Without refining that data to the individual lead level, it's hard to give real attribution value to the pageviews you see on G2C. Maybe it's a great first touch channel, but you'll never really know.
Applying reviews to multiple categories. Our technology meets the needs of multiple product categories, and it should be easier to ensure that our reviews pertain to all. 
Doesn't always have every solution / every product.
I think they could improve the way videos for readers are displayed like a YouTube grid instead of the current format.  That's about it.
We upgraded to license the grid and badge for our category.  Unfortunately, �Leader� badges are only added/updated on your profile when a report for the category which you are a Leader in is generated. There is no report scheduled for the category which are are a �Leader� in.  G2Crowd should update badges on profile when/as companies move around on the grid, otherwise the profile pages are inaccurate. In the category description it says "Leaders include: [our brand]" but our profile is reflecting we are a �High Performer� when we are actually a �Leader.�
There is not a streamlined process in handling reviews. This gets to be daunting and cumbersome.  I would like to see more documentation on best practices with reports, spiffs and responses. 
The only downside is that some product categories are less rich in reviews than others. Something that surely will take time to develop but worth looking forward to.
If there was something that I disliked, I wouldn't be taking the time to review the product offering.... But, the only thing I am waiting from them on is an API direct integration to SFDC so we can more readily leverage the active search data and push it to our sales team faster. (Update: we are now part of the BETA program for the G2Crowd SFDC connector!)
There's nothing I can think of that I dislike, except we can't control the traffic to our page as we would increase that if we could.
Probably more brand recognition of the site. I think G2 Crowd has a lot of potential -- and the more recognition they get, the more people will see and trust our reviews!
Nothing really. While their team is still building out new features that will may eventually become "core" to their platform, it already does the basics of what we need and their team is very responsive when helping us with additional needs. 
There could be made improvements to the visitor and prospect reports so that those leads and stats could be leveraged better.   Also would be great if the Leader batches are updated more often to allow for profile reflection of rid changes. 
There are sometimes some bugs on the admin side that prevent me from updating certain things right away, but those issues get addressed quickly by the G2 Crowd team.
Nothing I dislike, just the more data we can get to help support competitor comparisons, the better. 
So far we have been using Advocately for a few months and we have no complaints.
Nothing to dislike. It works well for our business and the onboarding was done via a 1 on 1 webinar. 
We'd like to expand our activities with G2Crowd, but understand that in order to remain independent the company is very stringent in the activities SpringCM can have with them.
The visitors section gives me mostly individuals who are not relevant to our business.
It can seem like there is a lot happening in the platform initially which can make self-implementation a cumbersome process. 
Lead generation is probably G2 Crowd's weakest link.
It is not possible to download all the customer reviews for further processing. There is a paid product that gives you additional insights but it doesn't directly provide an easy export option for all reviews either.
I would like to be able to collect more customized data.
At times there's too much data but that's easily solved by time and patience.
