Benefits of G2 Marketing Solutions
Building our brand and business through more exposure and inbound leads.
We've been able to effectively scale our review processes by encouraging our promoters to share their experience on various review websites. Previously this was a very manual exercise to connect and remind our promoters that we'd love their support. Now with Adovately we can politely reach out and explain how they could really help with our growth success by leaving a review of their experience.
We are finally recognizing the value of having advocates for our product who thankfully already existed, but were not given the opportunity to act as advocates. Having this process be automated saves a significant amount of time vs. any alternative. It is also much more cost efficient than running separate campaigns with each individual review site.
We went looking for a way to garner more reviews as they were severely lacking. We had cobbled together a fairly clunky and manual process and were going to roll it out. However, as soon as we found out about advocately, it all made sense. It's a well thought through workflow and it's very unobtrusive for our clients. 
Building an advocacy programme is hard. Advocately has had an immediate impact at a reasonable price point.
Reviews are not just good for your online reputation but offer other benefits, like showing star ratings in your AdWords ads, as well. Getting these reviews is a part of any good digital marketing strategy but usually is very hard to get rolling, Advocately takes care of this process for you and saves you tons of time and effort. 
Our customers leave us awesome reviews and refer their friends.
We wanted to find better ways to reach out to our NPS promoters and to get reviews on app marketplaces like Shopify and Xero.
This has been a fantastic tool for our Customer Success team to get insights about our customers. It's very easy to setup and the team at Advocately (especially Patrick) have been completely hands-on with the implementation, which has been truly amazing for us. 
We wanted to be able, in the first place,  to have a suitable medium to be able to encourage customers to provide us with their NPS scores and that was achieved.  Advocately has provided further set up automation to  reach out to our NPS Promoters, with the end goal to generate Customer Advocacy in terms of Reviews and Referrals
We get a lot of verbal reviews and written feedback, unfortunately there is very little which contributes to any platforms. We used advocate.ly to get those reviews contributing to NPS. 
Getting good reviews isn't easy. It takes time, consideration, and often gets pushed aside by other projects. Advocately does the asking and consideration for us, so that it doesn't get pushed aside.   Along with the massive help Advocately has provided me with our advocate marketing plan, it has also enhanced our SEO efforts. Many of the organic search results we obtained are fueled by customer reviews. Social proof is a HUGE influencer in our marketing efforts.   Another extremely important aspect of Advocately is that we are able to identify our users who don't love the product. This gives us the opportunity to reach out to provide further support so that they can learn to love our software. As a company is it SO important to listen to what users experience and Advocately makes this so easy.
Convincing our most loyal customers to leave detailed 4/5 star reviews on the platforms that influence customer acquisition, at a volume that makes a real difference.
A lot of manual work to get a very small subset of reviews. I was spending too many hours a month to get a very small amount of reviews, but with Advocately I've been able to get way more out of less work. It's saved me so much time!
For a startup of our size, it would have required a lot of manual work to get to where we are now with Advocately, and we managed to get so much done within a short amount of time thanks to their platform.
A way to quickly understand the different players in a space without doing a ton of research - which is very helpful and valuable to me as a Sales person.
Ensuring that our prospects have a clear understanding of who we are and the competitors in the same space
It enables us to add validity into what we are doing, it works perfectly!
Understanding where we need to improve on (whether that's user experience, customer service etc) for our customers and prospects to have a better experience with us. Also  allows me to give honest feedback and customer references to prospects
Competitive intelligence.  G2 Crowd can help us win business.
Reviews on various market places! Listings have improved and number of reviews have increased! 
G2 Crowd is an integral part to our internal advocacy program and allows us to measure how well we're doing in concerns to external references.
Giving potential customers a source of third-party data they can review to learn more about our product. Building trust and gathering use cases. Discovering new potential buyers we can engage with.
Again, the trust and credibility issues we were having in the past have diminished considerably. This has been a great investment for our business.
It is a site that prospects can go to for unbiased reviews and it provides prospects with lots of valuable product information in a single location. I have just started with G2 Crowd and as yet have not realized any benefits but I am confident that I will see good quality leads over the second half of this year. 
We are attempting to bring in more leads from G2 Crowd, but unfortunately we are not seeing the volume we would have expected.
The problem that we are solving is being able to find high quality, in-market leads. G2 Crowd is one of our highest lead to opportunity channels in the marketing mix. 
We are leveraging the Act-On review page, industry benchmarking reports and retargeting. 
Vendor provided case studies are great, but we wanted reviews and comments that were impartial to assist with speeding the sales decision making process for prospects.  Our sales team often share our G2 Crowd page to demonstrate how open and proud we are of our software and service. 
Originally, I planned to use G2 Crowd to help raise awareness of our product and put us on the radar for people looking at PR tools. The Grid and comparisons are really helpful assets for our sellers to provide third party validation of our great support and product. The most valuable benefit has turned out to be the sales leads it generates - we now get quality leads every week that our sales team LOVES to follow up on. 
We needed to greater our brand awareness.   We have a great product and we were not seen. G2Crowd has given us the opportunity to display our worth by letting our customers speak for us. We are now listed side by side with our competition with a legitimate position. 
Ability to get honest reviews from our customers, while also showcasing the value they've found to our prospects. 
We value an unbiased ranking of our software.  We will refer prospective customers to view our ratings on G2 Crowd to validate their decision making.

G2crowd helps us identify new advocates that are big promoters of the Marketo brand. It also gives us direct line of sight for how we can improve quickly and stay nimble in a very competitive industry. 
You can self-research business solutions instead of dealing with salespeople. Even if you do end up going through a sales demo, you'll be that much more prepared and efficient with the time spent. 
It takes the headache out of having to ask and chase down customers to participate. Plus, because it's a 3rd party site; the reviews instantly have more credibility. 
It's been helpful for sales, customer success, and product development. For sales, it lets us share the Bonusly experience with potential customers, customer success gets feedback about how happy customers are, and the feedback is helpful to guide product development as well. 
It always was a problem how to get reviews in different review websites. We were trying to ask our loyal clients to write their feedback in certain resources, but didn�t get much from this experience.  I think Advocately is smart solution for any business. It is not limited campaign, you are getting positive reviews from your clients all the time and only from those, who rated our service 9 or 10.

Brand Awareness and Brand Interest.
We have a very finite market for our product, and G2 Crowd allows us to filter our leads in an effective way. Thus far, we've received a few good leads (which, for us, is great).
We came to G2 Crowd after using another platform for a while as we wanted to expand our reach. We are still using the other solution too, but hands-down we prefer the quality of reviews and impressive support from G2 Crowd.  Their solution is not only putting us in front of a new audience, it's also allowing us to deepen relationships with existing clients and improve our product.
We are able to attract new customers who are looking for the best HCM software because our current customers have validated their success stories.  G2 Crowd is our "references" for potential new customers.
We are taking full advantage of our customer advocacy with this platform. We find that prospects trust their peers more than the vendors themselves and G2 Crowd is the perfect place for prospects to find the reviews they need straight from the customer.
We are a start up in a very competitive industry but G2 Crowd helps us stand out and connect with people who are looking for our services.
Working with our rep, we were able to get a good amount of reviews that helped us gain more visibility for our brand.
Brand Exposure,  Brand Awareness and Lead generation
G2 Crowd is the service that we use for capturing our customer testimonials. Since it's a 3rd party service,  it's a place that our customers can use to provide their honest opinions. It's independent of our website, so prospective customers can get objective reviews and hear directly from a wide spectrum of people that are already using our software. It's a great complement to content on our website - https://www.singlewire.com.
More awareness from those looking for event solution. Just not always the right people.
It enables us to build brand equity and more effectively compete against larger companies.  If you're an established company with a loyal customer base, you're ideally positioned to optimize your G2 Crowd investment.
Educate prospects on how the product was received by others, and what improvement users have noticed over time. 
Better engagement with our end users. G2 Crowd is a great outlet for customers and partners to provide unbiased feedback that we can use to improve our technology. It also helps us potential customers make more informed decisions about their technology investments. 
We use this as another web property to source inbound interest. It seems to capture a different group of people than our main website does.
We are excited to use our �Leader� status in marketing and sales, especially since a formal grid/quadrant from Forrester or Gartner does not exist. 
Great platform for current customers to see into additional functionality and prospects to see what the product can do. It also helps my company to see what we excel at and what we need to work on. 
This platform is adding a new dimension to how we market and sell to our customers.  The insight that can be shared from reviews and where users spend their time whilst on the platform allows marketers to form a view on who their buyers are and what they are interested in.  G2Crowd is changing the way we all learn about, evaluate and purchase b2b software. We don't go out to eat somewhere new without checking out tripadvisor or yelp and we certainly don't book a holiday before checking out reviews and pictures from people who have actually been there.  G2Crowd brings this piece of mind to b2b software. It amazes that many companies still make significant purchasing decisions on outdated and obscure reviews from old school analysts who have probably never used the product.  G2Crows is solving for a massively underserved market of buyer and sellers who could all do with more transparency and trust!  
I look at G2 Crowd as a partner in our success; a channel for us to influence buyers and get in front of those accounts that are in market to buy Marketing Automation. G2Crowd is one of our highest quality and healthiest converting demand gen channels. Over the last 3 years, we've had a 5x ROI from our investment in G2Crowd; I can attribute close to 2M in opportunity pipeline and 400K in won deals from our branded business profile alone. 
We have been able to increase credibility with our audience that we were already speaking with, and we have been able to generate awareness and start conversations with companies we were not yet speaking with. Hence, it helps us fill up the top of the funnel and speed up our sales cycle.
3rd party reviews are great to help our serious customers when shopping for solutions to push them over the edge with our stellar reviews! We've used these reviews in multiple marketing campaigns, and our sales reps know that they can utilize their specific product pages to help customers learn more.
Generating more positive word of mouth marketing through software reviews.
 Working with G2Crowd has been a great way to generate more customer testimonials, but also to improve out lead gen and sales prospecting campaigns. 
We use G2 Crowd for customer advocacy and as a place for potential customers to read honest reviews provided by our actual users across a variety of roles and industries. G2 Crowd helps us create credibility in the market by allowing our customers to provide feedback about our products, services, and our company as a whole.
