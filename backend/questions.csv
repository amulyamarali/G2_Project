You're handed IP addresses that get matched against a spotty database (e.g. you will see a lot of ""Comcast LLC viewed your page"") and that's it. Without refining that data to the individual lead level, it's hard to give real attribution value to the pageviews you see on G2C.

First of all, as Customer Satisfaction is very important to us, we use it to gauge how happy our users genuinely are, with our products.    Equally as important, as a sales leader, we also use this site for references.  All prospects will eventually ask for references prior to making a purchase.  As our business unit is growing quickly, this can often cause reference fatigue as they are hit up over and over again.  Plus, IMO the reference process isn't perfect anyway for the prospect, as they will be biased.  So instead, we have our salespeople just point their prospects to G2Crowd instead.  ""Instead of me giving you the names of my 5 best customers, why don't you go to G2Crowd instead?  There you'll find verified reviews of actual users (not analysts that have never used the tools themselves), of our solution as well as our competitors.  And then from there you can do as many backdoor references as you'd like.""    This is win/win.

For marketers of Cazoomi, we need to get into the mix of those spec & select decisions where B2B readers, decision makers or influencers, translate into potential buyers.   We engaged G2 to get cool B2B Infographics, Comparative reports, and key product marketing advice, which is one of the most targeted approaches to comparative based content we think. This allows our small marketing team to engage SMEs at G2 who hail from the Integration industry and know our business well.  We can then share our unique client stories with them and be creatively involved with the story we want to express to the B2B buyer who really relies on reviews and expert content when making decisions which affect not only yearly budgets but also sensitive data migration and integration compliance projects.  As a bonus, all the research and infographics are easily shareable, which makes them a great asset to use in social media platforms, email campaigns, and other digital channels our marketing team use to inform potential integration software buyers.  Overall, I could not say enough about the decision this 2017 to work with G2 to augment our product comparative marketing efforts.
